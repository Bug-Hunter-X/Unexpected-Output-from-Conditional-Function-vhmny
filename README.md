# Julia Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a simple Julia function. The function `myfunction` is designed to square positive numbers and negate negative numbers.  However, the current implementation produces unexpected results for an input of 0. 

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file offers a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of thorough testing, especially considering edge cases, when developing functions in any language, including Julia.
